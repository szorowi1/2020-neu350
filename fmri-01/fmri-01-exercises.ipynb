    "## Section 1: Defining the HRF\n",
    "To predict how the BOLD signal should evolve in response to some stimulus, we need to define the shape of the hemodynamic resposne function (HRF). As a reminder, the HRF is the predicted shape of the BOLD signal in response to an instaneous stimulus. Much like the action potential, the canonical HRF has two distinct phases: an initial **rising phase** and a subsequent prolonged **undershoot**. In general, the rising phase peaks around 6s and the trough of the undershoot occurs around 16s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the shape of the HRF is modeled by the superposition of two **[gamma distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution)**. Neuroscientists use the gamma distribution because it is right-tailed. This asymmetry nicely captures what is typically observed of the HRF.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a HRF, we will import the `spm_hrf` function from `fmritools`. This function has several parameters that will let you create HRFs of arbitrary shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **t1:** Delay of response relative to onset (in seconds), aka the length of the rising phase.\n",
    "- **t2:** Delay of undershoot relative to onset (in seconds).\n",
    "- **d1:** Dispersion of response, or the width of the rising phase.\n",
    "- **d2:** Dispersion of undershoot, or the width of the undershoot.\n",
    "- **ratio:** The size of the response relative to the undershoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the `spm_hrf` function requires the **repetition time (TR)** as its first input. The TR is the sampling frequency of an fMRI experiment, or how often we acquire one complete image of the brain. The TR defines the smoothness of the idealized HRF. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, try plugging in different values to the `spm_hrf` function and see the HRF it produces. What values of the five parameters above create an HRF that most resembles what you saw in lecture?"
